To run Galileo Web Terminal in Windows 7 64 bit we need to:

1. Upgrade Com4J to release 20120426
2. Modify Windows 7 using regedit.exe.

To do this, it involves a small number of simple registry change:

1. Locate your COM object GUID under the HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\CLSID\[GUID]
   Once located add a new String Value. 
   Name should be AppID and data should be the same COM object GUID 
   you have just searched for
2. Add a new key under HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\AppID\
   The new key should be called the same as the com object GUID
   Under the new key you just added, add a new String Value, 
   and call it DllSurrogate. Leave the value empty
3. Create a new Key under HKey_Local_Machine\Software\Classes\AppID\
   Again the new key should be called the same as the COM object’s GUID. 
   No values are necessary to be added under this key.
